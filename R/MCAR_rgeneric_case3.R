  ## Implementation of MCAR(B, Sigma) model described in Jin et al. 2007 as Case
  ## nÂ°3. They proved that the joint distribution of phi is given by
  # phi ~ N(0, (A \kr I_n) (I_p \kr D - B \kr W) ^ (-1) (A \kr I_n)')
  # where B is a p x p symmetric matrix, W is the adjacency matrix, D is a
  # diagonal matrix with elements m_i that denote the number of neighbours of
  # area i and AA' = Sigma, i.e A is the upper triangular cholesky square root
  # of Sigma. The distribution is well-defined if 1 / eps_min < xi_j < 1 with
  # indices j = 1, ..., p, where eps_min is the minimum eigenvalue of
  # D^(-0.5)WD^(-0.5) and xi_j are the eigenvalues of B. 
  #
  # This should imply that I can write the joint distribution of phi as
  # phi ~ N(0, [(A ^ (-1) \kr I_n)' (I_p \kr D - B \kr W) (A ^ (-1) \kr I_n)] ^ (-1))
  #
  # It's difficut to design a prior for B that satisfy that condition, so the
  # authors used a different approach, they represented B using it's spectral 
  # decomposition. B = PDeltaP' where P is the orthogonal matrix of eigenvectors
  # and Delta is diagonal matrix of ordered eigenvalues xi_1, ..., xi_p. 
  # The p x p orthogonal matrix P is characterized using the p * (p - 1) / 2
  # Givens angles theta_ij for i = 1, ..., p - 1 and j = i + 1, ..., p. The
  # matrix P is written as the product of p * (p - 1) / 2 matrices, each
  # associated with a Givens angle: P = G12 * G13 * ...  G_(p-1)p where the
  # indices i and j are distinct and G_ij is a p x p identity matrix with the
  # ith and jth diagonal elements replaced by cos(theta_ij), and the (i, j) and
  # (j, i) elements replaced by \pm sin(theta_ij). The Givens angles are unique
  # with a domain [-pi/2, pi/2] and the eigenvalues xi_j are in range
  # (1/eps_min, 1), the authors put a Uniform prior (-pi/2, pi/2) on theta_ij
  # and U(1/eps_min, 1) prior on xi_j.
  # Sigma is a positive definite covariance matrix and the inverse Wishart prior
  # distribution renders itself as a natural choice.
  
  # Start with p = 2
  # The INLA-vector theta is composed by 6 elements:
  # 1, 2: xi_1 and xi_2, the eigenvalues of B. They must lie in the range
  #       (1/eps_min , 1) so we used a "sort-of" inverse logit 
  #       transformation. We assign to them a Uniform prior between 
  #       1 / eps_min and 1. The matrix Delta is a diagonal matrix with 
  #       elements xi_1 and xi_2. 
  # 3   : theta_12, which is the first (and only) Givens angle. It must lie in
  #       the range [-pi/2, pi/2] (or [0, pi/2]) so we assigned a uniform 
  #       prior between -pi/2 and pi/2. The matrix P is created as 
  #       [cos(theta_12) & sin(theta_12) \\ -sin(theta_12) & cos(theta_12)]. 
  #       The matrix B is created as P Delta P'
  # 4, 5: the marginal precisions of Sigma
  # 6   : the correlation parameter. 
  # The elements 4, 5, 6 are combined for creating the matrix Sigma
